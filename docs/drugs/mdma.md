[Guide on how to reduce MDMA neurotoxicity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borax/comments/w5c1x/a_stepbystep_guide_to_reducing_mdma_neurotoxicity/) is a must read. [Borax Combo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borax/comments/tufa3t/is_there_an_updated_version_of_the_mix/) is a nice mix with similar effects.

I personally like to take small amount of clean well tested MDMA or [5-MAPB combo](https://realchems.net/blue-bliss-pellets-2-fma-5-meo-mipt-5-mapb) on truly special occasions. Usually as a therapeutic session with my partner. No more than once a year. Even if your relationship is already open to all kind of communication, MDMA helps bring all barriers down and all issues can be discussed freely if there are any or you can simply enjoy each other's company and listen to great music together or play games.

I make sure to take [5-HTP](https://drbvitamins.com/products/doctor-s-best-5-htp-enhanced-with-vitamins-b6-c-120-veggie-caps-8) on the night of the trip before I go to sleep. And following 3-4 days. I also drink a lot of [tea](../health/nutrition/drinks/tea.md) as it helps with recovery too. I usually do it as a habit already. And I continue on with my already rather [healthy diet](../health/nutrition/nutrition.md), [supplements](../health/nutrition/supplements.md) and [daily exercise](../fitness/fitness.md).

That keeps MDMA neorotoxicity to its minimum and more importantly having one year breaks between doses makes each experience very special too without ever losing its magic. It's sometimes nice to mix it up with [psychedelics](psychedelics/psychedelics.md), either [psilocybin mushrooms](psychedelics/tryptamines/tryptamines.md) or [LSD](psychedelics/lysergamides/lsd.md) but don't overdo on the doses.

## Notes

- [It is good to take 5-HTP and EGCG the night after your experience (assuming you've fully come down) and for 3-7 days after the experience.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/ng8dsk/how_long_before_taking_mdma_should_i_stop_taking/)
- For proper mixing LSD & MDMA, take MDMA 3 hours after LSD. They synergize & potentiate each other so don't take a lot of each.
- [If you decide to dose both, I recommend dosing the Molly 3 to 3.5 hours after you dose Lucy. I like to ride the Lucy peak then on the come down the Molly kicks in and creates an altered trip. But if it is your first Lucy trip I'd say stick to only that and become familiar with the effects. Completely up to you though, both experiences are incredible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/bntg7c/_/en8y59a/?context=1)
- [Experts advise to wait at least 3-5 weeks between taking MDMA, and recommend 3 months.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/ohdx5u/doing_mdma_every_day/)
- [~ 100mg is good MDMA dose, anything higher has a lot of negative effects.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/onyegg/mdma/)
- [20mg of 2-FMA, 2mg of 5-meo-mipt, and 80mg of 5-mapb at the same time | supposedly similar to MDMA but with less neurotoxicity](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/vfvuhq/whats_the_best_rc_for_parties/)
- [For Borax combo you need: 1. Selective serotonin releasing agent (like MDAI, MNA, or well, 5-MAPB, although that's not as selective). 2. Dopamine-norepinephrine releasing agent (NDRA), so 2-FMA, 3-FPM or similar. 3. 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Most psychedelics hit that receptor, low dose of a 4-substituted tryptamine of your choice is perfect. Ideally you want your 3 substances to have roughly the same onset and duration, so you can take them all at once. Dosage depends a lot on the individual (body weight, tolerance, and how strong you prefer your rolls). You can freely adjust every part of it though, if for example you enjoy a very physically stimulating experience, you can go for a higher dose of the stimulant; if you want more visuals and headspace, go for something like 15mg 4-HO-MET instead of 5mg, and so on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Borax/comments/tufa3t/is_there_an_updated_version_of_the_mix/)
- [MDMA is chiefly acting at serotonin receptor sites and so often doesn't get serious attention as an addictive substance. However, MDMA also interacts at the oxytocin receptor sites; this can induce feelings of connectedness, closeness, nurturing, and love. Furthermore, as illustrated recently by the MAPS trials looking at PTSD, MDMA reduces activity in the amygdala (lessening fear responses), and increases activity in the vmpFC (in essence, executive control). For people who are running away from trauma--a, if I might say, "large" sub-demographic of addicts/substance abusers, not feeling fear in conjunction with feeling control, love, and euphoria is a perfect experience and often, addictive.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/y9wy8l/can_someone_explain_why_mdma_isnt_as_addictive_as/)
- [Take around 500-600mg of 5-HTP day after your roll.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/yer78m/finally_got_my_hands_on_this_how_often_should_i/)
