# Mushrooms

[Mycelium](https://www.micropia.nl/en/discover/microbiology/mycelium/) is fascinating.

I personally love [psilocybin mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom) and take them [occasionaly](../drugs/psychedelics/psychedelics.md). I also take some mushrooms daily as part of my [supplement](../health/nutrition/supplements.md).

## Notes

- [We think of mushrooms as being "the fungus" but really a mushroom is just a temporary structure that the fungus, which a network of hyphae buried in the substrate, builds to disperse its spores. They're like a protrusion from an unseen world into ours.](https://twitter.com/NotBrunoAgain/status/1520055622997270534)
