# My Workflow

One of my bigger passions in life is being able to do more with less. [Life is short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html) and I want to [maximize the fun outcomes in life](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1367871165319049221).

In spirit of maximizing outcomes, I want more amazing, kind and happy humans all around the globe and I want to do my part in making a dent on the world. My workflow below is what makes me move faster in life, I hope it helps/inspires you too in some way. ♥️

## Project tools

- [GitHub](../open-source/github/github.md) - Code sharing & collaboration. Issues & Roadmaps for OSS projects. Want [Height](https://height.app/)/[Linear](https://linear.app/) level desktop client for GitHub. Like [Ship](https://www.realartists.com/blog/ship-20.html).
- [Height](https://height.app/) - All internal projects. [Also have `Personal` board](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1586439817516429312) to realign ideas I work on with my big focuses for the month.
- [Notion](../tools/notion.md) - Everything wiki, collaboration. Team Docs.
- [Discord](../tools/discord.md) or [Telegram](../tools/telegram.md) - According to type & size of project. Small community/project, Telegram group is great. Open source or community project, Discord. More corporate, maybe Slack. But it's super expensive & unusable for open communities.

- [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) - Video screen sharing & collaboration.
- [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) - Quick insights/analytics from data. Hooks up to Postgres easily & lets you run intuitive queries & make dashboards.

## Cloud Compute

- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) preferred for APIs. [Fly](https://fly.io/) & [Railway](https://railway.app/) are nice too.
- For serving websites, [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) are great. I try use [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) as my API is on Cloudflare Workers already.
- [AWS](../cloud-computing/aws/aws.md)/[GCP](../cloud-computing/gcp/gcp.md) have some niche useful services I use too.

## Utility

- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - Quick sketches, thinking things through.

- [Feedback Fin](https://github.com/rowyio/feedbackfin) for collecting feedback.

## Design System
