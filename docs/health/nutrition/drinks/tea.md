# Tea

I drink a lot of tea & prefer it to [coffee](coffee.md) as it doesn't give me focus crashes and disrupt sleep. [white2tea](https://white2tea.com/) is great place to get tea from.

[Sheng Puerh Tea](https://www.thespruceeats.com/shou-vs-sheng-766448) is great. Brewing it "gong fu" style, drinking it for the whole day. Filling my clay teapot or a gaiwan with tea at the morning and then brew it until the evening without emptying/refilling.

[Meta Mate](https://metamate.cc/) is great for getting yerba mate tea which gives a lot of energy.

## Notes

- You need a special tea knife to cut the tea cakes.
- If pure coffee-like stimulation is what you're after, look into yerba mate.
