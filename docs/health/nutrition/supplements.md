# Supplements

Every [morning](../../focusing/processes.md#morning), after I do a [workout](../../fitness/fitness.md), I make a [smoothie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUGQBV5B2S4). I mix:

- 2 scoops of [Clean Lean Protein (Just Natural taste)](https://www.nuzest.co.uk/products/clean-lean-protein) (~ 25g)
- 1 scoop of [Good Green Vitality](https://www.nuzest.co.uk/products/good-green-vitality) (~ 10g)
- 1 table spoon of [Organic MyComplex Mushroom Powder](https://mushrooms4life.com/shop/mushroom-complex-powder-60g/)
- 1 table spoon of [Organic Lion’s Mane Mushroom Powder](https://mushrooms4life.com/shop/lions-mane-mushroom-powder-60g/)
- 2 raw eggs
- Spinach (for extra fiber)
- Frozen blueberries (for better taste + healthy)
- Plain greek yugurt (for texture)
- Fill with [Alpro Unsweetened Almond Milk](https://www.alpro.com/uk/products/drinks/almond-drinks/almond-roasted-no-sugars/) (fill the blender glass)
- Chia, hemp and flax seeds with walnuts on top (not much)

After drinking the smoothie, I also take these supplements, inspired by [Rhonda Patrick](https://fastlifehacks.com/dr-rhonda-patricks-supplements-list/):

- [Vegan Omega 3 DHA & EPA via Algal oil](https://www.uganutraceuticals.com/product/omegor-veg) (3 capsules)
- [Vitamin D3 + K2 + C](https://nootropicsdepot.com/vitamin-d3-k2-c-supplement/) (1 capsule)
- [Magnesium](https://nootropicsdepot.com/magtein-magnesium-l-threonate-capsules/) (1 capsule morning & 2 before sleep)
- [B12 Sublingual](https://nootropicsdepot.com/super-b12-sublingual-solution/) (0.5mL drop)

That's often enough to get me going until afternoon at which point, I will either make some cooked food or eat out ([healthy](nutrition.md)).

I don't try to manage my eating of generally healthy natural whole food pescatarian food. Especially as I try to lead a more active lifestyle already.

I generally strictly avoid sugary foods, snacks and drinks. Makes me appreciate the finer tastes of non processed foods and ways you can cook them. I try to experiment with various [pescatarian recipes](recipes.md) often too.

I sometimes don't eat during evenings so as to [fast](fasting.md) just a little before I take my morning smoothie on following day.

Also whilst not strictly supplements, I enjoy taking [psychedelics](../../drugs/psychedelics/psychedelics.md) with breaks of at least 2+ months. [Tryptamines](../../drugs/psychedelics/tryptamines/tryptamines.md) being my favorite, usually consumed through actual home grown psilocybin mushrooms & not some [research chemical](../../drugs/research-chemicals.md) like [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT).

## Interesting

Some maybe interesting supplements. Some I tried but stopped.

- [Multivitamin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Multivitamins-Multivitamin-Vegetarians-Nu-Nutrition/dp/B01IFGDNVS) (1 capsule)
- [Sulforaphane](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jarrow-Formulas-Broccomax-Vcaps-Capsules/dp/B01D15LMCK) (1 capsule)
- [Vegan Omega 3 DHA & EPA](https://www.amazon.com/VEGAN-OMEGA-Supplement-Cardiovascular-Supplements/dp/B01MYE95BQ) (1 capsule)
- [Lions Mane](https://oriveda.co.uk/lions-mane.php) (1 capsule)
- [Daily Thyroid Care Supplement](https://www.palomahealth.com/product/thyroid-supplements)

## Notes

- [Pregnant women taking 1,000 mg of the omega-3 DHA had 50% fewer early preterm births than women given 200 mg. The high dose DHA also reduced feeding issues and genitourinary and neurologic problems in infants (randomized controlled trial).](https://twitter.com/foundmyfitness/status/1397251661618352133)
- [Recent study suggests anti inflammatory meds contribute to chronic pain by preventing an inflammatory process that resets the pain baseline. We have been using these for decades and didn’t catch this. This should make you nervous about playing Guinea pig.](https://twitter.com/karnagraha/status/1528490268546068480)
- [Iron is needed in the electron transport chain as a component of cytochrome C oxidase. If fewer iron molecules are being prioritized for creating this enzyme, then less oxygen will be reduced at a time. The rest of the Krebs cycle can be in an optimal state but the cycle can only go as fast as the electron transport chain will allow it. I imagine that given a deficiency, the human body will prioritize iron formation in the blood over creating new cytochrome C oxidase since transporting oxygen to cells is more important than running the Krebs cycle at full speed.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31968114)
